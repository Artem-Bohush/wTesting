It is a high-level interface to control Chrome browser via [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). Also it supports headless mode.

Puppeteer works with any testing framework, but our samples and tutorials are using [wTesting](https://github.com/Wandalen/wTesting).
