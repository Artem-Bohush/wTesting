# Testing cheat sheet

Framework for convenient unit testing. This cheat sheet summarizes commonly used Testing command line instructions and test suite structure for quick reference.

### Installation of `Testing`

To install Testing you need an installed Node.jsÂ® and Node package manager ( NPM ).

```
npm install -g wTesting
```

Global installation of utility Testing by NPM.

### Main commands

All commands of the utility start with `tst .`.

```
tst .help
```

Get help.

```
tst .help [ command ]
```

Get help about separate command.

```
tst .suites.list [ path ]
```

Find test suites at a specified path.

```
tst .run [ path ]
```

Run test suites found at a specified path.

```
tst .imply [ options... ] .run [ path ]
```

Change state or imply variable value.

### Running of test suites

```
tst .run [ path to single test file ]
```

Running of single test suite.

```
node [ path to single test file ]
```

If module Testing installed locally, you can run test suite by NodeJS interpreter.

```
tst .run [ path to directory with group of test files ]
```

Running a set of test suites. NodeJS can't test a set of test suites.

### Often used running options

To control testing the running options is used.

```
tst .imply routine:[ name ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `routine` allows test separate test routine in test suite. Accepts name of test routine. Option has shortened entry form - `r`.

```
tst .imply verbosity:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `verbosity` sets the verbosity of report, that is, the amount of output information. Option has shortened entry form - `v`. Accepts a value from 0 to 9. Default value is 4.

```
tst .imply testRoutineTimeOut:[ time ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `testRoutineTimeOut` limits the testing time for a test routine. Testing time sets in milliseconds. Default value is 5000ms.

```
tst .imply accuracy:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

The option `accuracy` sets the numeric deviation for the comparison of numerical values. Accepts numeric values of deviation. Default value is 1e-7.

```
tst .imply sanitareTime:[ time ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `sanitareTime` sets the delay between completing the test suite and running the next one. Delay sets in milliseconds. Default value is 2000ms.

```
tst .imply importanceOfNegative:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

It is intended to restrict the output of information of routines with the status `ok` / `pass` and to increase the amount of information about the checks with the status `failed`. Accepts a value from 0 to 9. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply silencing:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `silencing` enables hiding the console output from the test object. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

```
tst .imply shoulding:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `shoulding` designed to disable negative testing. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

### Additional running options

Running options that extend control of testing.

```
tst .imply fails:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `fails` sets the number of errors that the utility must receive to pre-complete the test. Accepts number of fails. Default number of fails is unlimited.

```
tst .imply beeping:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `beeping` is intended to turn on the beep after the test is completed. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply coloring:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `coloring` desined to enable the color marking of the test report. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply timing:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `timing` intended to disable measurement of time spent on testing. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply rapidity:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

The option `rapidity` controls the amount of time spent on testing. Test time changes if option `rapidity` of test routines has different values. Accepts values from 1 to 5. Default value is 3.

```
tst .imply  concurrent:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `concurrent` desined to enable parallel execution of test suites.
Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

### Test suite structure

The test file should contain only one test suite.
The minimum test file is given below. It uses the basic structural elements and can be considered as a test suite template.

```js
////
// dependency injection section
////

let _ = require( 'wTesting' );  // inject utility Testing
let Join = require( './Join.js' );  // inject test object

////
// test routines definition section
////

function routine1( test ) // test routine
{
  test.case = 'concatenation of strings';  // test case definition
  test.identical( Join.join( 'Hello ', 'world!' ), 'Hello world!' ); // test check
}
routine1.timeOut = 10000; // test routine option

function routine2( test )
{
  // some code
}

////
// test suite definition section
////

var Self =   // test suite map
{
  name : 'Join',  // test suite name

  silencing : 1,  // test suite option
  shoulding : 1,  // test suite option

  tests :  // test suite routines
  {
    routine1, // routine defined in test routines definition section
    routine2, // routine defined in test routines definition section
  }
}

////
// test suite launching section
////

Self = wTestSuite( Self ); // launching by module Testing
if( typeof module !== 'undefined' && !module.parent ) // launching by NodeJS interpreter
wTester.test( Self.name );
```

Test file structure consists of four main sections.

- Dependency injection. Should inject module Testing and test objects.
- Test routines definition. Contains routines that test separate functionalities of a test object. Test routines consist of test cases and test checks.
- Test suite definition. Defines map with test suite settings.
- Test suite launching. Allows to run test suite by utility Testing and by NodeJS interpreter.

### Test checks

Module Testing contains next test checks:

- `is( boolLike arg )` - passes if argument is true-like.
- `isNot( boolLike arg )` - passes  if argument is false-like.
- `isNotError( errorLike arg )` - passes if argument is not error.
- `identical( any arg1, any arg2 )` ( shortened form `il` ) - passes if both arguments are identical. The numerical deviation is not allowed.
- `notIdentical( any arg1, any arg2 )` ( `ni` ) - passes if both arguments are not identical. The numerical deviation is not allowed.
- `equivalent( any arg1, any arg2 )` ( `et` ) - passes if both arguments are similar. The numerical deviation is allowed.
- `notEquivalent( any arg1, any arg2 )` ( `ne` ) - passes if both arguments are not similar. The numerical deviation is allowed.
- `contains( any arg1, any arg2 )` - passes if the arguments are identical or the first argument contains the second argument.
- `gt( numberLike arg1, numberLike arg2 )` - passes if the value of the first argument is greater than the value of the second.
- `ge( numberLike arg1, numberLike arg2 )` - passes if the value of the first argument is greater or equal to the value of the second.
- `lt( numberLike arg1, numberLike arg2 )` - passes if the value of the first argument is less than the value of the second.
- `le( numberLike arg1, numberLike arg2 )` - passes if the value of the first argument is less or equal to the value of the second.
- `mustNotThrowError( routine arg )` - expects one argument in the form of a routine, which runs without arguments to test its work. passes if the routine does not throw an error either in synchronous or in asynchronous mode.
- `shouldMessageOnlyOnce( routine arg )` - Expects one argument in the form of a routine, which runs without arguments to test its work. The check passes if the routine ends synchronously or the result returns only one message.
- `shouldThrowErrorSync( routine arg )` - expects one argument in the form of a routine, which runs without arguments to test its work. Passes if the routine throws an error synchronously.
- `shouldThrowErrorAsync( routine arg )` - expects one argument in the form of a routine, which runs without arguments to test its work. The check passes if the routine throws an error in asynchronous mode.
- `shouldThrowError( routine arg )` - expects one argument in the form of a routine, which runs without arguments to test its work. The check passes if the routine throws an error in synchronous or asynchronous mode.
