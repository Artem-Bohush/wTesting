## Quick start

For quick start [install](<./tutorial/Installation.md>) utility `wTesting`, [get acquainted with](<./tutorial/Running.md>) command line interface and create the first [test "Hello World"](<./tutorial/TestCreation.md>). [Read](<./tutorial/Abstract.md>) abstract if you are wondering what is it for and what philosophy is behind utility `wTesting`.

For gentle introduction use tutorials. For getting exhaustive information on one or another aspect use list of concepts to find a concept of interest and get familiar with it.
