# Testing cheat sheet

Framework for convenient unit testing. Utility Testing provides the intuitive interface, simple tests structure, asynchronous code handling mechanism, colorful report, verbosity control and more. This cheat sheet summarizes commonly used Testing command line instructions for quick reference.

### Installation of `Testing`

To install Testing you need an installed Node.jsÂ® and Node package manager ( NPM ). If you do not have it then download the version for your operating system from [official site](<https://nodejs.org/en/>) and follow the [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

```
npm install -g wTesting
```

Global installation of utility Testing by NPM.

### Main commands

All commands of the utility start with `tst .`.

```
tst .help
```

Get help.

```
tst .suites.list [ path ]
```

Find test suites at a specified path.

```
tst .run [ path ]
```

Run test suites found at a specified path.


```
tst .imply [ options... ] .run [ path ]
```

Change state or imply variable value.

### Running of test suites

```
tst .run [ path to single test file ]
```

Running of single test suite.

```
node [ path to single test file ]
```

If module Testing installed locally, you can run test suite by NodeJS interpreter.

```
tst .run [ path to directory with group of test files ]
```

Running a set of test suites. NodeJS can't test a set of test suites.

### Mostly used running options

To control testing the running options is used.

```
tst .imply routine:[ name ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `routine` allows test separate test routine in test suite. Accepts name of test routine. Option has shortened entry form - `r`.

```
tst .imply verbosity:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `verbosity` sets the verbosity of report, that is, the amount of output information. Option has shortened entry form - `v`. Accepts a value from 0 to 9. Default value is 4.

```
tst .imply testRoutineTimeOut:[ time ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `testRoutineTimeOut` limits the testing time for a test routine. Testing time sets in milliseconds. Default value is 5000ms.

```
tst .imply accuracy:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

The option `accuracy` sets the numeric deviation for the comparison of numerical values. Accepts numeric values of deviation. Default value is 1e-7.

```
tst .imply sanitareTime:[ time ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `sanitareTime` sets the delay between completing the test suite and running the next one. Delay sets in milliseconds. Default value is 500ms.

```
tst .imply importanceOfNegative:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

It is intended to restrict the output of information of routines with the status `ok` / `pass` and to increase the amount of information about the checks with the status `failed`. Accepts a value from 0 to 9. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply silencing:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `silencing` enables hiding the console output from the test object. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

```
tst .imply shoulding:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `shoulding` designed to disable negative testing. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

### Additional running options

Running options that extend control of testing.

```
tst .imply fails:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `fails` sets the number of errors that the utility must receive to pre-complete the test. Accepts number of fails. Default number of fails is unlimited.

```
tst .imply beeping:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `beeping` is intended to turn on the beep after the test is completed. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply coloring:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `coloring` desined to enable the color marking of the test report. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply timing:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `timing` intended to enable measurement of time spent on testing. Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 1.

```
tst .imply rapidity:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

The option `rapidity` controls the amount of time spent on testing. Test time changes if option `rapidity` of test routines has different values. Accepts values from 1 to 5. Default value is 3.

```
tst .imply  concurrent:[ number ] .run [ path ]
```

Option `concurrent` desined to enable parallel execution of test suites.
Accepts 0 or 1. Default value is 0.

### Combining of running options

Any of running test options can be combined in a set.

```
tst .imply routine:someRoutine verbosity:5 .run [ path ]
```

Example shows combination of option `routine` and `verbosity`.
